// Create a class named 'Shape' with a method to printShape "This is shape". 
// Then create two other classes named 'Rectangle', 'Circle' inheriting the Shape 
// class, both having a method to print "This is rectangle" and "This is circle" 
// respectively. Create a child class 'Square' of 'rectangle' having a method to 
// printSquare "Square is a rectangle". Now call the method of 'Shape' and 'Rectangle' 
// class by the object of 'Square' class.
