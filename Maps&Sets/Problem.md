Sure! Here are some basic problems to help you master Maps and Sets in JavaScript:

**Maps:**

1. **Problem: Word Frequency Counter**
   Create a function that takes a string as input and returns a Map where keys are unique words, and values are their frequencies in the string.

2. **Problem: Sorting a Map**
   Write a function to sort the entries of a Map based on the keys or values and return a new Map with the sorted entries.

3. **Problem: Map Operations**
   Implement a function that takes two Maps and performs basic set operations like union, intersection, and difference.

**Sets:**

1. **Problem: Finding Unique Elements**
   Write a function to take an array as input and return a Set containing only the unique elements of the array.

2. **Problem: Set Operations**
   Implement functions for set operations such as union, intersection, and difference between two sets.

3. **Problem: Subset Check**
   Create a function that checks if one set is a subset of another.
