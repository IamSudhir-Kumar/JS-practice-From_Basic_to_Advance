// Problem 1: Counting Letters

// Write a program that takes a string as input and counts the occurrences of each letter (case-insensitive). Use a Map to store the letter as the key and the count as the value. Display the letter count for each letter.

// Problem 2: Removing Duplicate Numbers

// Create a function that takes an array of numbers and returns a new array with duplicate numbers removed. Use a Set to efficiently track unique values.

// Problem 3: User List with Set
